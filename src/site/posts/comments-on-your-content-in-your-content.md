title: Comments on your content, in your content

There are a few solutions out there for adding comments to your site without the need to make your own commenting system. So why bother with this?

## Part of your site

If comments about your content are valuable, then it is nice if they form part of your content too. Tools which host your comments in their own platform, and inject them into your site with JavaScript silo the comments away from your site. They are unlikely to result in search engine hits for your site, since they are not part of your site.

The Jamstack comments approach makes comments part of your site. You choose how to include them within the content of your site. And since you bake them right into your pages, they will appear in search engines.
